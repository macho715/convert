Dear Sir,

Here with the information as requested below:
1.	We have not received the approved stability booklet for LCT Bushra. Please provide the approved booklet if available or confirm whether the attached lightship particulars obtained from the sister vessel LCT Natrah are applicable to LCT Bushra. Pls find scanned light ship condition for BUSHRA.
2.	Please confirm whether the piping arrangement onboard LCT Bushra is as per the attached piping schematic and is fully operational. Also confirm the availability of the pumps indicated in the drawing and confirm that the ballast piping system is fully functional to perform tank ballasting as required during the load-out/load-in. Bushra using Fresh water for ballast and the pump fully functional to transfer freshwater ballast, cargo and/or ship use in between freshwater tanks, using freshwater transfer pump. For your information, transfer ballast in between tank should be crossing, e.g. STBD FWBT No.01 to PORT FWBT No.2 or other tanks on the PORT side. 
3.	The attached "Ballast Tank Candidates" file which we received as input indicates that FW1P and FW1S (Tank Nos. 10 and 11 in the tank capacity plan) are available for ballasting. However, according to the piping schematic received, these tanks do not appear to be connected to the ballast system. Please verify and confirm whether these two tanks are connected to the ballast system and available for ballasting. These tanks connected to freshwater ballast pump and can be used as ballast, normally, these tanks used for ship use freshwater.

Hope this helps.

Dear Sir,

For now, we will use the Initial loading condition you have provided for our calculation.
I was asking you to reply to my previous comments, I have copied the comments below for your easy reference. 
1.	We have not received the approved stability booklet for LCT Bushra. Please provide the approved booklet if available or confirm whether the attached lightship particulars obtained from the sister vessel LCT Natrah are applicable to LCT Bushra.
2.	Please confirm whether the piping arrangement onboard LCT Bushra is as per the attached piping schematic and is fully operational. Also confirm the availability of the pumps indicated in the drawing and confirm that the ballast piping system is fully functional to perform tank ballasting as required during the load-out/load-in.
3.	The attached "Ballast Tank Candidates" file which we received as input indicates that FW1P and FW1S (Tank Nos. 10 and 11 in the tank capacity plan) are available for ballasting. However, according to the piping schematic received, these tanks do not appear to be connected to the ballast system. Please verify and confirm whether these two tanks are connected to the ballast system and available for ballasting.
 
4.	We have received the Tidal prediction data for December. Please provide the Tide prediction data for January 2026 as well. kindly confirm the exact Chart Datum (CD) reference level with respect the quay wall elevations.

Dear Sir,

For the actual condition as per your request no easy to do, vessel still full operation and we do have more water than the list and also, we have fuel less than the list.
Furthermore, vessel always have cargo onboard, and fast movement to serve our current client.
It would be more accurate if vessel stay in the port, calm sea and have enough fuel and fresh water as requested. 

Pls advise.

Dear Mr. Cha/ LCT Bushra Master,

We kindly request your assistance to confirm the initial condition of LCT Bushra.
Please fill the tanks as per the attached "Initial loading condition document". Once all the tanks are filled to these levels, we would appreciate it if you could take actual draft readings at the forward, aft, and midship draft marks.
Kindly provide us the observed draft readings at the forward, aft, and midship draft marks.

Dear Yulia, Dear Pranil,

Please find below the key minutes and action items from today's RoRo/load-out call for LCT BUSHRA.

Main points
•	Mammoet will rerun the simulation after receiving updated data and LCT master confirmation.
•	Mammoet stated: "We trust your data, but we need to do a simulation again."
•	Great Waters reviewed the tank plan/ballast options and will submit a calculation summary to Samsung, including ballast requirements.
•	Drawing shows 3.00 pumps. Pump capacity is 50.00 m³/h (as discussed).
•	Ballasting and load transfer may take about 2.00 hours, within a 3.00–4.00 hours rising-tide window (as discussed).
•	Weather and small waves may affect ramp contact and SPMT operations.
•	The Aurora simulation input file shared so far is for the 1-TR case only. Mammoet will check internally and share the two-transformer (2 TR) input file if available.
Action items
Item	Owner	Note
Share updated FWD/AFT draft data (same format)	Samsung / Great Waters	For Mammoet re-simulation
Submit ballast calculation summary	Great Waters	Include ballast requirement and assumptions
Confirm pump availability/connection/status with LCT master/owner	Samsung + LCT Master/Owner	Required for confirmation
Request/share Aurora simulation card file for 2-TR case	Mammoet	Subject to availability

Best regards,
```

Mr. Cha, good afternoon!

MMT Team will join the meeting.


Attached please find the requested CAD file for the RoRo operations.


Our proposed solution, based on the ballast draft provided by the LCT Master, is to perform LO/LI of one TR unit per trip.

This is subject to confirmation by the LCT Master regarding the draft calculations and tide accuracy.

Kindly note that MMT cannot be held responsible for any damage to the LCT ramp during RoRo operations should the provided data prove to be inaccurate.

Dear Pranil,

Based on Mammoet's latest feedback dated 01-Jan-2026 regarding the RoRo / Load-out operation, 
we request a limited set of additional calculations to confirm feasibility under realistic tide conditions.

Mammoet has stated that:
•	TR2 shows a ramp–12 m linkspan clash at 100% load under a 2.10 m tide.
•	TR1 shows a similar clash at ~1.80 m tide (second week of January).
•	While a 2.50 m tide would avoid the clash, Mammoet also confirmed that no 2.50 m tide occurs between Jan–Apr 2026.

As reliance on a 2.50 m tide is not practical, mitigation under available tide conditions is required.
Please confirm if you can include the following additional items in your submission:
1.	Ballast / trim adjustment during the critical ramp stage (75% → 100%)
o	Stage-wise Draft (FWD/AFT), Trim, GM/Freeboard
o	Ballast plan and pumping sequence with hold points
2.	Minimum required tide per critical stage (TR1 & TR2)
o	Including sensitivity to ±0.02 m draft variation
3.	Forward draft reduction at the 100% on-deck (high LCG) condition
4.	Water tide calculation for operability
o	Stage-wise operability check using the official tide table (CD basis)
o	Practical tide criterion for RoRo / Load-out execution

Best regards,
```

Dear Mr. Jung,

Thank you for your email.
Noted CAD files are not available. We will manage with the PDF.
Could you please share the lines plan/offset tables  of the vessel? Even a PDF format is fine.

Dear Pranil,

The GRM requested information for Tank Capacity Plan/GA in CAD format is not available but we believe that GWM is able to work out (as similar as what GRM did before) using the PDF format provided by Mr. Cha as attached.
Please find the "Schematic Bilge Ballast Fire-Main System.pdf" as attached.
And attached method statement of "LOAD-OUT, LOAD-IN & LAND TRANSPORTATION OF TRANSFORMERS (TM-63) FROM MINA ZAYED PORT TO INSTALLATION AREA AT AL GHALLAN ISLAND" prepared by MAMMOET will be definitely helpful (in particular, Drawings in Appendix) for your work.

We would like to reiterate that GRM's early Submission of Deliverables (before 12/Jan/'26) will be appreciated.

[For instance]
 
Regards.
