RoRo transport of AGI transformers (TR1 & TR2) is planned on LCT BUSHRA with SPMT loadout at Mina Zayed.
Because load is transferred progressively, draft, trim, GM, and freeboard must be checked at each stage.
Mammoet rejected the prior stability package due to limited stage-wise verification.
Therefore, third-party engineering and a stage-wise ballast/pumping plan are required to finalize RoRo drawings
and confirm minimum tide.





Considering Mammoet’s technical requirements and the TR1/TR2 schedule, Great Waters Maritime L.L.C is selected
to perform the stage-wise stability and ballast calculations for LCT BUSHRA. Their proposal (Ref: GWM-E13430-L001-311225, Rev.1, 31 Dec 2025)
covers the required deliverables and timeline.

[UAE HVDC]- SPMT Loadout and Stability
Calculation for AGI Transformers (TR1 & TR2)
'31st. Dec. 2025(Wed)

- Project  : UAE HVDC (Project Lightning)
- Contract : Third Party Engineering Service (SPMT Loadout & Stability Calculation)
- Vendor   : Great Waters Maritime L.L.C
- Amount   : 11,000.00 USD (Excluding VAT 5%)
- LPO No.  : To be issued
- Payment  : 50% Advance, 50% upon first issue of the report
- Budget   : Logistic Cost
□ Background

    RoRo transportation of AGI (Al Ghallan Island) transformers (TR1 & TR2) is planned using LCT BUSHRA,
    with SPMT loadout operations at Mina Zayed. Due to the cargo weight and the progressive load transfer,
    the vessel draft, trim and stability must be verified stage-by-stage.
  

    Based on Mammoet’s technical review, the previously submitted stability package was deemed not acceptable
    due to insufficient stage-wise load transfer verification. Accordingly, third-party engineering calculations,
    stage-wise ballast planning and draft verification are required to support RoRo drawing finalization and
    minimum tide verification.
  
□ Scope of Work

    Great Waters Maritime L.L.C shall provide engineering support for the SPMT loadout of Transformers TR1 & TR2 on LCT BUSHRA,
    including stability assessment during 9 load transfer stages, verification of trim, GM, displacement, draft and freeboard,
    and preparation of a stage-wise ballast plan and pumping sequence with cumulative time.
    The deliverable will be an SPMT loadout report with a stage-wise summary table and ballast plan.
  
□ Selection

    Considering the technical requirements from Mammoet and the project schedule constraints, Great Waters Maritime L.L.C has been selected
    to perform the required engineering analysis. They have submitted their commercial proposal (Ref: GWM-E13430-L001-311225, Rev.1, dated 31st Dec 2025)
    covering the required scope and deliverables.
