24/10/24 PM 1:16 - Yulia MAMMOET: Dear Team, 
By now our Marine Crew loaded equipment onto LCT and did the marking. 
Without the PTW for Hot works we can’t proceed with gas cutting of 18pcs of d-rings. 
These D-rings don’t allow us to set up the steel mats on LCT
24/10/24 PM 1:17 - Yulia MAMMOET: By the way, our Supervisor told us that ADNOC representative told them load-out is not possible tomorrow because Bushra needs to leave the berth due to other works
24/10/24 PM 1:21 - Jay DSV: Please wait till PTW and Hot permit is approved
24/10/24 PM 1:21 - Jay DSV: They should know the procedure
24/10/24 PM 1:34 - Yulia MAMMOET: Dear Jay, good day! 
Is it possible to bring second forklift to SPMT crew? 
With 1 forklift it will take more time.
Cause initially we planned to use crane together with forklift for the beam change to happen faster. 
Now I see the crane is near LCT
24/10/24 PM 1:34 - Jay DSV: We need to book in advance
24/10/24 PM 1:35 - Jay DSV: Same day is not possible
24/10/24 PM 1:35 - Jay DSV: But I will check
24/10/24 PM 1:35 - Jay DSV: Appreciate if you can make advance plan for any equipment required
24/10/24 PM 1:40 - Jay DSV: Hi Yulia, are you using the crane right now?
24/10/24 PM 1:40 - Jay DSV: If not, the operator can take forklift and use him
24/10/24 PM 1:41 - Jay DSV: Please confirm
24/10/24 PM 1:42 - Yulia MAMMOET: No, right now no
But the forklift is also away because the driver is having lunch…
24/10/24 PM 1:42 - Yulia MAMMOET: For beam change we need both forklift and crane or 2 forklifts
24/10/24 PM 1:54 - Jay DSV: Sorry no available forklift as of now but in case there is they will provide
24/10/24 PM 1:55 - Yulia MAMMOET: Okay then 
Since we still don’t have permit to hot works and we can’t position the load spreaders in LCT can we bring the crane to SPMT yard?
24/10/24 PM 1:55 - Yulia MAMMOET: The forklift driver should be back by 2pm
24/10/24 PM 1:58 - Jay DSV: You have the equipments and you can proceed with your plan

At 04:00am 1st axel should be already on the ramp 
So SPMT has to start moving from its current position to Jetty at 03:00am and be there by 3:30am <This message was edited>
24/10/25 AM 11:35 - CHA: ofco team will reply soon
24/10/25 AM 11:36 - Yulia MAMMOET: Also, please, make sure that there will be enough lighting both sites: SPMT site and Jetty <This message was edited>

24/10/25 PM 11:16 - Haitham: Once bushra receive 150T FW

Draft FWD will become 2m
At 06:00 AM tide will be 1.03m 

Means that vessel deck relative to the jetty will go down 0.58 m

So ramp angle would correspond to zero and maybe will be negative 

Also the additional plates between the ramp and jetty will compensate the rest
24/10/25 PM 11:22 - Haitham: Back on track

1. Reinspection of SPMT should be done by who? Samsung HSE?
2. What exact "adequate number" of mooring lines will be provided?
24/10/26 AM 10:06 - CHA: For point 2, more mooring  ropes are to be added, as we understand from Ouda it will be provided.
Extra morning ropes, extra capacity.
The bita of the jetty capacity is okay, but the vessel mooring point capacity might be less.
Therefore, the captain will start the engine and push forward while loading the TR to support the operation

For point 1, we are waiting for Ouda's feedback. we understand that the SPMT has been inspected previously.

24/10/26 PM 12:18 - Yulia MAMMOET: Dear Samsung Team, good day.

Following shared via WhatsApp screenshot of email from Captain Abboud Bazeyad, Mammoet understands that RoRo operation can be performed upon meeting these critical requirements:

1. Tug on stand-by and Pilot on-board during the operation
2. Adequate number of Mooring lines
3. Maximum wind speed of 15 knots, otherwise operation to stop
4. Compliance with required tidal window, otherwise operation to stop
5. Hot work Permit and Permit to work overwater obtained

Since Hot Work Permit and Permit to work overwater have been obtained, we kindly ask you to confirm 1-4 critical points.

Also, following my phone call with Mr. Cha, I understood that mooring plan and calculations can be submitted after the RoRo operation.
I kindly ask you to check it with Mr. Ouda of ADNOC ALS, since they are providing the vessel and they may be concerned regarding Safety.

If Mooring plan can be submitted later - please, confirm this to us.

Please, share with us your decision on mobilization of Mammoet personnel tomorrow, 27-October, by 02:00pm today.

We would also require Samsung Team to be present at the load out operation.

Thank you!
24/10/26 PM 12:24 - CHA: noted and we reply before 2pm
24/10/26 PM 1:28 - CHA: Dear Julia

Good day.

We confirm our agreement with the critical requirements outlined for the upcoming RoRo operation:

Tug will be on standby, and a Pilot will be onboard during the operation.
Adequate mooring lines will be secured.
The operation will be suspended if wind speed exceeds 15 knots.
Compliance with the required tidal window will be observed, with operations paused as needed.
Regarding the mooring plan and calculations, we understand that they can be submitted after the RoRo operation. Therefore, the operation can proceed as scheduled without delay.

Additionally, we confirm our acceptance of any additional costs incurred for work conducted on Sunday.

We also confirm the mobilization of Mammoet personnel on October 27, with the Samsung Team present to support the load-out operation.

24/10/30 AM 8:17 - CHA: ***For reference only***
The optimal time window for Roll-on operations on October 31 would be late afternoon.
Reasons:
1.	Wave height: Waves remain low throughout the day, minimizing interference with operations.
2.	Wind speed: While wind speeds are slightly higher in the morning, they decrease to around 10–15 km/h in the afternoon, providing more favorable conditions for the operation.
3.	Wind gusts: Gusts are also expected to weaken later in the day, making late afternoon the safest period.
Recommended Time
The best time for Roll-on operations would be between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, as this period is expected to offer the most stable and safe conditions.
