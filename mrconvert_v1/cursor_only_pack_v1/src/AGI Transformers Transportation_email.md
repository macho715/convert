Dear Mr. Haitham,

Good Afternoon.

As discussed, the method statement, ballast sequence & the final sailing condition was informed to be prepared by M/s MAMMOET and only the intact stability checks during the various steps of loadout were assigned to us.

From the trailing emails its noted that ballasting/de ballasting will not be done during the process and the LCT will be at a constant draft and trim initially. We will require this initial loading condition of the vessel for our stability check.

Kind Regards

Dear Mr. Haitham,

Good day!

As discussed, sending you description of the following scopes which are part of our current scope of work

Strength check of the steel bridge
Verification of the structural adequacy of the temporary steel bridge (or link span) that will connect the jetty and the LCT during the loadout operation. The analysis will confirm that the bridge can safely transfer the combined load of the SPMT and cargo to the vessel deck without exceeding allowable stress or deflection limits.

Bow Deck Strength Calculation
Assessment of the LCT bow deck structure to ensure it can sustain the applied wheel loads from the SPMT during the loading and offloading operations. The calculation will determine load distribution and confirm compliance with the vessel's allowable deck loading capacity.

Intact Stability check during the loading sequence
Evaluation of the vessel's intact stability throughout the loadout operation, from the initial ballasting condition to final loading. The analysis will verify that the vessel remains within acceptable stability criteria and maintains adequate trim and heel at all stages of the operation.

Following information would be required to complete this task

- Ballast tank arrangement and capacity plan.
- Sequence of loading (step-by-step movement of SPMT and cargo).

Kindly note that, as per our previous discussion regarding the job scope of the subject vessel, our understanding was to perform an intact stability check for the loading conditions corresponding to each loadout sequence provided by your team.

To facilitate this, we were requesting you to share the complete loading sequence for the barge, including the load on the barge and the amount of ballast at each step.

The loads previous have been also approximately estimated from our end to carry out the Strength check of the steel bridge and the bow deck structure but for loadout this needs to be recalculated more accurately as this is related to the vessel stability.

The loadout calculation is a detailed engineering assessment carried out to ensure the safe and controlled transfer of the cargo (transformer) from the shore/jetty onto the LCT vessel using SPMT.
This analysis covers the following aspects:

Determination of load distribution and reactions on the jetty, steel bridge, and vessel deck during each stage of the SPMT movement.
Evaluation of the vessel's intact stability and trim/heel conditions throughout the loading sequence.
Calculation of hydrostatic parameters and verification against applicable stability criteria (e.g., GM, righting arm curve, and permissible heel angles).
Assessment of the required ballast adjustments at each stage to maintain safe stability and acceptable draft/trim levels. If not ballasting can be done during loading due to any reason then we will have to study what is the draft that needs to be maintained throughout this loading operation etc.
Identification of any critical stages where corrective ballasting or operational control is required.

Above is a brief description for your info.

In case that our scope is extended to include preparation of the complete loadout sequence, we will need to develop the detailed loading steps, load transfer stages, and ballasting plan from the basics.

This will involve additional engineering effort for:

- Developing the full loadout plan and sequence,
- Performing detailed static and stability calculations for each stage, and
- Preparing the supporting documentation and reports.

As informed, this additional scope will have time and cost implications, and is expected to require approximately 7–10 working days to complete, subject to receipt of all required data.

Please review and confirm your intention for us to proceed with this additional task, so that we can update our proposal and schedule accordingly.

Thanks and Best Regards,
From Aries Marine, UAE
Sonal Singh

Dear Mr Haitham,

The deck strength calculation for the bow deck area of LCT Bushra, where the link span will be resting/ in contact with the deck has been reviewed. The analysis has been checked for the reaction load of 201 tons at the span, as previously shared in our load case calculations. Based on the results the deck has been found to be structurally adequate and safe for the assessed load condition.
Attached is the analysis summary for your info.

Let us know if any queries / questions.


Thanks and Best Regards,

Dear Mr Haitham and team

Please note that we have reviewed the loading condition shared in the below email from LCT Bushra. Its noted that in the condition shared there is no trim for the vessel, however in the reference document for the previous loadout the aft trim was maintained for the vessel to adjust with the draft changes it the bow side when the load is happening. See snap below.

Please confirm if 0 trim will be maintained during the current loadout of 217T transformer. 

As per previous email from Mr @ minkyu.cha@samsung.com  "The BUSHRA-specific Method Statement v0.1 and the stepwise Loading Sequence will be re-issued immediately upon receipt from Mammoet" we await to get this document for our review and use.

Dear Mr. Haitham,

Further to the below correspondence from Mammoet, it appears there has been a misunderstanding regarding our previous confirmation.
Please note that our earlier communication confirmed the structural adequacy of the vessel's bow deck structure at the ramp landing location for the applied loads. However, the structural analysis of the link span (ramp) itself is still in progress, as previously informed, and is expected to be completed within this week.
Kindly coordinate with the Mammoet team to clarify this point, as the email from Yulia suggests the understanding that the ramp structure has already been verified as satisfactory for the loads, and based on that, mobilization from Malaysia is being considered.

Please let us know if any further clarification is required.


Thanks and Best Regards,
From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear Yulia,

Aries has confirmed bow deck adequacy for 201-ton reaction at the linkspan contact area. The 12m linkspan review is ongoing.

To complete Aries' intact stability assessment, please provide the Stepwise Loading Sequence with the following per step:
•	SPMT and cargo movement (sequence/positions)
•	Load on barge
•	Ballast amount per tank (tonnes)

Please advise your ETA. We will forward your submission to Aries immediately upon receipt.

Best regards,
```

Good morning, Mr. Cha!

Please, see comments from our side below:

•	SPMT and cargo movement (sequence/positions) – LO/LI RORO Simulation and Stowage Arrangement will be submitted by 03.11 (next Monday)
•	Load on barge – Can you, please, specify what exactly is required from MMT?
•	Ballast amount per tank (tonnes) – This is not MMTs scope. I believe, this request shall be addressed to LCT's Chief Engineer upon receival of above documents.

Thank you!

Dear Mr Haitham

Attached is the summary results of the link span structural analysis completed based on the loads calculated when the transformer is transported from jetty to the vessel.
Based on the analysis, the obtained vonmises stress of 169.57 Mpa is within the allowable stress limit of 248.5 Mpa. Hence the linkspan is found to be structurally safe and adequate for 9 axial at a time condition.

Kindly also arrange to share the ballast sequence / loading conditions for the loadout operation to proceed with the intact stability checks.


Thanks and Best Regards,
From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear all 
Good day 

Kindly note that we had submitted our initial condition on even keel as per our present condition.

As per your request for ballast loading sequence, we must inform you that our ballast pump rate capacity is only 10tons per hour, so if you think that if we can maintain our even keel trim while loading, I believe it will take time to compensate the even keel while loading.

How ever the only thing we can provide is to prepare the initial loading condition draft required like what we did before from previous heavy lift and after the first loading of transformer then that the time we will do some ballast for second loading.

To make clearer from our side please advise us the required initial that's the only thing we can prepare for initial loading, ballast loading sequence to keep even keel, it will take time.

Dear Captain / Mr. Haitham,

Good Morning.

Well noted your trailing email. 
Please note that the draft and trim to be maintained in the initial condition at site is to be provided by M/s "MAMMOET" as the BUSHRA specific load out calculations & method statement for the cargo will be prepared by them.
Hence, we would request M/s MAMMOET to revert with this information.
