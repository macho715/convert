By now our Marine Crew loaded equipment onto LCT and did the marking. 
Without the PTW for Hot works we can’t proceed with gas cutting of 18pcs of d-rings. 
These D-rings don’t allow us to set up the steel mats on LCT

Is it possible to bring second forklift to SPMT crew?

Now I see the crane is near LCT

2024-10-25 23:16 - Haitham: Once bushra receive 150T FW

Draft FWD will become 2m
At 06:00 AM tide will be 1.03m 

Means that vessel deck relative to the jetty will go down 0.58 m

So ramp angle would correspond to zero and maybe will be negative 

Also the additional plates between the ramp and jetty will compensate the rest

Extra morning ropes, extra capacity.
The bita of the jetty capacity is okay, but the vessel mooring point capacity might be less.
Therefore, the captain will start the engine and push forward while loading the TR to support the operation

For point 1, we are waiting for Ouda's feedback. we understand that the SPMT has been inspected previously.

2024-10-26 12:18 - Yulia MAMMOET: Dear Samsung Team, good day.

Following shared via WhatsApp screenshot of email from Captain Abboud Bazeyad, Mammoet understands that RoRo operation can be performed upon meeting these critical requirements:

1. Tug on stand-by and Pilot on-board during the operation
2. Adequate number of Mooring lines
3. Maximum wind speed of 15 knots, otherwise operation to stop
4. Compliance with required tidal window, otherwise operation to stop
5. Hot work Permit and Permit to work overwater obtained

Since Hot Work Permit and Permit to work overwater have been obtained, we kindly ask you to confirm 1-4 critical points.

Also, following my phone call with Mr. Cha, I understood that mooring plan and calculations can be submitted after the RoRo operation.
I kindly ask you to check it with Mr. Ouda of ADNOC ALS, since they are providing the vessel and they may be concerned regarding Safety.

If Mooring plan can be submitted later - please, confirm this to us.

Please, share with us your decision on mobilization of Mammoet personnel tomorrow, 27-October, by 02:00pm today.

We would also require Samsung Team to be present at the load out operation.

Thank you!

Good day.

We confirm our agreement with the critical requirements outlined for the upcoming RoRo operation:

Tug will be on standby, and a Pilot will be onboard during the operation.
Adequate mooring lines will be secured.
The operation will be suspended if wind speed exceeds 15 knots.
Compliance with the required tidal window will be observed, with operations paused as needed.
Regarding the mooring plan and calculations, we understand that they can be submitted after the RoRo operation. Therefore, the operation can proceed as scheduled without delay.

Additionally, we confirm our acceptance of any additional costs incurred for work conducted on Sunday.

We also confirm the mobilization of Mammoet personnel on October 27, with the Samsung Team present to support the load-out operation.

Thank you for your collaboration.

2024-10-30 08:17 - CHA: ***For reference only***
The optimal time window for Roll-on operations on October 31 would be late afternoon.
Reasons:
1.	Wave height: Waves remain low throughout the day, minimizing interference with operations.
2.	Wind speed: While wind speeds are slightly higher in the morning, they decrease to around 10–15 km/h in the afternoon, providing more favorable conditions for the operation.
3.	Wind gusts: Gusts are also expected to weaken later in the day, making late afternoon the safest period.
Recommended Time
The best time for Roll-on operations would be between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, as this period is expected to offer the most stable and safe conditions.
