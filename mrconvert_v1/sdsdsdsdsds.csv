"8.        Stability Assessment
8.1      Intact Stability Criteria
This section is intended to present the criteria regarding stability analysis of the barge.
A cargo barge shall have positive stability in calm water equilibrium position. In addition, the  system  shall  have  sufficient  dynamic  stability  (righting  ability)  to  withstand  the overturning effect of the force produced by a steady wind from any horizontal direction.
In order to examine the stability of the system, criteria from GL Noble Denton 0030/ND, Guidelines for Marine Transportation and IMO are considered as follows.
1) The critical metacentric height should not be less than 0.15 meter.  (IMO Code on Intact Stability for All Type of Ships Resolution A-749).
2) Range of Positive Stability Ø
The stability of the transportation barge shall be positive to a heel angle Ø beyond equilibrium as given below:
   Heel angle, Ø will be greater than or equal to 40 degree, otherwise.
   Heel  angle,  Ø  will  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  greater  of  30  degree  or (R+15+15/GM) degree.
where,
R    = Smaller or equal to the maximum dynamic heel angle in degree due to wind  and  waves  in  design  sea  state  for  the  tow  route  or  to  the  heel angle where the maximum righting moments occurs.
GM   = Initial metacentric height, corrected for free surface effects in meters.
3) The area under righting lever curve up to the angle of maximum righting lever, or the angle of down flooding, or 40 degrees, whichever is less, should not be less than 0.08 m-rad. (4.58 m-deg). (IMO Code on Intact Stability Special Criteria for Certain Types of Ships -Resolution A.749  )
4) The  area  under  the  righting  arm  should  not  be  less  than  3.15  m-deg  (0.055  metre-radian) up to an angle of heel 30 degree. (IMO Code on Intact Stability For All Type Of Ships Resolution A-749)
5) The area under the righting arm curve between the angles of heel of 30deg and 40deg, or the down flooding angle, should not be less than 1.72 m-deg (0.03 metre-radian).
6) The righting lever should be at least 0.20 metres at a heel angle equal to or greater than 30 degree. (IMO Code on Intact Stability for All Type of Ships Resolution A-749).
7) The maximum righting lever should occur at an angle of hell not less than 15 deg.
8) Dynamic Stability
The area under the righting moment curve will be greater than 1.4 times the area under the wind heeling moment {(A+B)  1.4 (B+C)} as per the stability curve, Fig. 2.2 calculated up to an angle of heel corresponding to the second intercept of the two curves.
The wind heeling moment is calculated on the basis of 1-minute mean wind speed.  The
wind speed is 100 Knots."

"9.        LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH VERIFICATION
To check the longitudinal strength of the vessel, the shear force, bending moment and deflection of the vessel are calculated and compared with the allowable shear stress, bending stress and deflection.
It is necessary to have the shear area and section modulus of the vessel which is calculated from the vessel construction drawings.
For all conditions, the allowable bending stress is assumed to be 175 MPa (as per ABS) and for shear stress it is 110 MPa .
For shear area calculation, the watertight longitudinal bulkhead plates, side shell plates  of the vessel and longitudinal stiffeners are considered (based on construction drawings).
For vessel section modulus calculation, the deck and bottom plates are included on top of that for shear area calculation. Addition to that side stiffeners and top and bottom stiffeners are also included. The section modulus at the bottom is used, being the lesser of the two. Refer detailed results and section modulus calculation in Appendix C

10.      CONCLUSION										
The load-out analysis for loading of two transformers of 240 MT each onto the vessel “LCT Bushra” is performed and the following conclusions are made.										
     Intact Stability Analysis during the loadout of transformer-1 & transformer-2 has been performed and is found to be satisfactory.										
     Longitudinal    strength    assessment    during    the    Loadout    of    transformer-1    & transformer-2 has been conducted and is within allowable limits.										
     A  minimum  tide  of  1.8 m  is  required  to  commence  the  operation,  and  all										
operations must be completed at or above this tide level.
