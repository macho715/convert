Subject: RE: [HVDC] - AGI Transformers Transportation - Vessel Stability and Deck Strength / LCT Bushra DU5025

 

Dear Mr. Haitham,

Good day!

 

As discussed, sending you description of the following scopes which are part of our current scope of work

Strength check of the steel bridge
Verification of the structural adequacy of the temporary steel bridge (or link span) that will connect the jetty and the LCT during the loadout operation. The analysis will confirm that the bridge can safely transfer the combined load of the SPMT and cargo to the vessel deck without exceeding allowable stress or deflection limits.

Bow Deck Strength Calculation
Assessment of the LCT bow deck structure to ensure it can sustain the applied wheel loads from the SPMT during the loading and offloading operations. The calculation will determine load distribution and confirm compliance with the vessel’s allowable deck loading capacity.

Intact Stability check during the loading sequence
Evaluation of the vessel’s intact stability throughout the loadout operation, from the initial ballasting condition to final loading. The analysis will verify that the vessel remains within acceptable stability criteria and maintains adequate trim and heel at all stages of the operation.

Following information would be required to complete this task

-          Ballast tank arrangement and capacity plan.

-          Sequence of loading (step-by-step movement of SPMT and cargo).

 

Kindly note that, as per our previous discussion regarding the job scope of the subject vessel, our understanding was to perform an intact stability check for the loading conditions corresponding to each loadout sequence provided by your team.

To facilitate this, we were requesting you to share the complete loading sequence for the barge, including the load on the barge and the amount of ballast at each step.

The loads previous have been also approximately estimated from our end to carry out the Strength check of the steel bridge and the bow deck structure but for loadout this needs to be recalculated more accurately as this is related to the vessel stability.

 

The loadout calculation is a detailed engineering assessment carried out to ensure the safe and controlled transfer of the cargo (transformer) from the shore/jetty onto the LCT vessel using SPMT.
This analysis covers the following aspects:

Determination of load distribution and reactions on the jetty, steel bridge, and vessel deck during each stage of the SPMT movement.
Evaluation of the vessel’s intact stability and trim/heel conditions throughout the loading sequence.
Calculation of hydrostatic parameters and verification against applicable stability criteria (e.g., GM, righting arm curve, and permissible heel angles).
Assessment of the required ballast adjustments at each stage to maintain safe stability and acceptable draft/trim levels. If not ballasting can be done during loading due to any reason then we will have to study what is the draft that needs to be maintained throughout this loading operation etc.
Identification of any critical stages where corrective ballasting or operational control is required.
 

Above is a brief description for your info.

 

In case that our scope is extended to include preparation of the complete loadout sequence, we will need to develop the detailed loading steps, load transfer stages, and ballasting plan from the basics.

This will involve additional engineering effort for:

-          Developing the full loadout plan and sequence,

-          Performing detailed static and stability calculations for each stage, and

-          Preparing the supporting documentation and reports.

 

As informed, this additional scope will have time and cost implications, and is expected to require approximately 7–10 working days to complete, subject to receipt of all required data.

 

Please review and confirm your intention for us to proceed with this additional task, so that we can update our proposal and schedule accordingly.

 

 

Thanks and Best Regards,

From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear Mr. Haitham,

 

Good Afternoon.

 

As discussed, the method statement, ballast sequence & the final sailing condition was informed to be prepared by M/s MAMMOET and only the intact stability checks during the various steps of loadout were assigned to us.

 

From the trailing emails its noted that ballasting/de ballasting will not be done during the process and the LCT will be at a constant draft and trim initially. We will require this initial loading condition of the vessel for our stability check.

Dear Eng. Haitham,

 

Bushra cannot maintain load-out condition due to low pump performance. Bushra is normally makes draft which is required by calculations performed by your 3rd party to start load-out, then your 3rd party will calculate every step of load-out with Bushras draft for our knowledge and correct application of load on vessel bow / ramp.

 

What is a reason you start asking Bushra to calculate something now. This is very confusing.

 

Why our 3rd party is not providing load-out calculation?

Dear Haitham,

 

Just to clarify, we were not planning to do any ballasting during load-out due to ineffective / small capacity pump. So ideally, we should plan the draft by bow sufficient for taking load on the bow, and then do final ballasting only during cargo securing stage for sailing condition.

Dear Mr Haitham

 

Well received the loading excel. We have checked the same. What we were also looking for is the ballasting sequence when the loadout operation happens. As per the initial meeting it was informed that Mammoet would be preparing this along with the method statement. Could you confirm on the same and provide this information at earliest please.

Dear Sonal,

 

201.6T is close to what I would expect as max load on vessel side of the link span at certain moment, then we see now the load is reducing from case 6.

 

Please proceed with this values for further Bushra’s bow structural calculation if bow structure will bear this load and what load spreader system of low profile to be added on top of fwd deck. As discussed, we would like to avoid internal modification of vessel structure.

Dear Mr Haitham, Mr Igor

Good day

 

Please find attached the revised load reaction calculations for your review and feedback.

In this update, the total load has been recalculated based on a uniform axle load of 25.2 t across all 12 axle lines, which represents a conservative assumption. Consequently, the resulting reactions for all load cases have increased accordingly.

The maximum reaction occurs in Load Case 5, with a value of 201.6 t.
Additionally, we have included Load Case 6, as requested, representing the condition with seven tyres in contact on the deck. In this case, the maximum reaction reduces to 179.6 t, and it is expected to decrease further as the SPMT advances onto the vessel deck.

 

Kindly review the attached file and advise if you have any queries or comments.

 

Thanks and Best Regards,

From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear Mr Haitham

 

Thanks for sharing the files. We have received most files earlier as well.

 

With regards to the Method statement, the one shared with us is for a previous operation with transformer load 169T and using the vessel ramp, please advise if the new method statement for the current transformer (217T) using the 12m RORO bridges and wedges is prepared that can be used for info.

 

We are currently working on calculating the loads that will be acting on the roro bridge and at the connection location on the vessel bow part. We will revert with our output within tomorrow to share the load details for review and further discussion.

Dear Sanjay,

 

Good morning.

 

Please find attached requested documents as below

1.    Intact & damage stability booklet

2.    Tank Capacity plan

3.    Deck and profile drawings

4.    Construction plan

5.    Shell expansion

6.    Transverse sections – Fore part

7.    Bow construction drawings

8.    Loading software set up file (if available)

Regarding items no -8

Vessel is using only Excel sheet as there is no loading software programme .

 

Kindly note some file password protected

Password :  US757-PS

 

Please share with us the load which you are planning to apply for vessel’s end of Link Span (bridge). This figure will be very disputable, so we need to agree on it from the beginning to proceed with all next calculation.

 

Please request all required drawings from Samsung for this link span, and request all required load sequence from Samsung / Mammoet to evaluate maximum possible load on vessel’s side of the link span.

 

Major concern from owners that Bushra’s bow structure will not hold expected load from link span end as is. Need either re-enforcement of the bow structure (better to avoid) or improve load spread under vessel side of link span on deck of Bushra.

 

Regards,
