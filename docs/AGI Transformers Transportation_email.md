Dear Mr. Haitham,

Good Afternoon.

As discussed, the method statement, ballast sequence & the final sailing condition was informed to be prepared by M/s MAMMOET and only the intact stability checks during the various steps of loadout were assigned to us.

From the trailing emails its noted that ballasting/de ballasting will not be done during the process and the LCT will be at a constant draft and trim initially. We will require this initial loading condition of the vessel for our stability check.

Kind Regards

Dear Mr. Haitham,

Good day!

As discussed, sending you description of the following scopes which are part of our current scope of work

Strength check of the steel bridge
Verification of the structural adequacy of the temporary steel bridge (or link span) that will connect the jetty and the LCT during the loadout operation. The analysis will confirm that the bridge can safely transfer the combined load of the SPMT and cargo to the vessel deck without exceeding allowable stress or deflection limits.

Bow Deck Strength Calculation
Assessment of the LCT bow deck structure to ensure it can sustain the applied wheel loads from the SPMT during the loading and offloading operations. The calculation will determine load distribution and confirm compliance with the vessel's allowable deck loading capacity.

Intact Stability check during the loading sequence
Evaluation of the vessel's intact stability throughout the loadout operation, from the initial ballasting condition to final loading. The analysis will verify that the vessel remains within acceptable stability criteria and maintains adequate trim and heel at all stages of the operation.

Following information would be required to complete this task

- Ballast tank arrangement and capacity plan.
- Sequence of loading (step-by-step movement of SPMT and cargo).

Kindly note that, as per our previous discussion regarding the job scope of the subject vessel, our understanding was to perform an intact stability check for the loading conditions corresponding to each loadout sequence provided by your team.

To facilitate this, we were requesting you to share the complete loading sequence for the barge, including the load on the barge and the amount of ballast at each step.

The loads previous have been also approximately estimated from our end to carry out the Strength check of the steel bridge and the bow deck structure but for loadout this needs to be recalculated more accurately as this is related to the vessel stability.

The loadout calculation is a detailed engineering assessment carried out to ensure the safe and controlled transfer of the cargo (transformer) from the shore/jetty onto the LCT vessel using SPMT.
This analysis covers the following aspects:

Determination of load distribution and reactions on the jetty, steel bridge, and vessel deck during each stage of the SPMT movement.
Evaluation of the vessel's intact stability and trim/heel conditions throughout the loading sequence.
Calculation of hydrostatic parameters and verification against applicable stability criteria (e.g., GM, righting arm curve, and permissible heel angles).
Assessment of the required ballast adjustments at each stage to maintain safe stability and acceptable draft/trim levels. If not ballasting can be done during loading due to any reason then we will have to study what is the draft that needs to be maintained throughout this loading operation etc.
Identification of any critical stages where corrective ballasting or operational control is required.

Above is a brief description for your info.

In case that our scope is extended to include preparation of the complete loadout sequence, we will need to develop the detailed loading steps, load transfer stages, and ballasting plan from the basics.

This will involve additional engineering effort for:

- Developing the full loadout plan and sequence,
- Performing detailed static and stability calculations for each stage, and
- Preparing the supporting documentation and reports.

As informed, this additional scope will have time and cost implications, and is expected to require approximately 7–10 working days to complete, subject to receipt of all required data.

Please review and confirm your intention for us to proceed with this additional task, so that we can update our proposal and schedule accordingly.

Thanks and Best Regards,
From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear Mr. Haitham,

Further to the below correspondence from Mammoet, it appears there has been a misunderstanding regarding our previous confirmation.
Please note that our earlier communication confirmed the structural adequacy of the vessel's bow deck structure at the ramp landing location for the applied loads. However, the structural analysis of the link span (ramp) itself is still in progress, as previously informed, and is expected to be completed within this week.
Kindly coordinate with the Mammoet team to clarify this point, as the email from Yulia suggests the understanding that the ramp structure has already been verified as satisfactory for the loads, and based on that, mobilization from Malaysia is being considered.

Please let us know if any further clarification is required.


Thanks and Best Regards,

Dear Mr Haitham

Attached is the summary results of the link span structural analysis completed based on the loads calculated when the transformer is transported from jetty to the vessel.
Based on the analysis, the obtained vonmises stress of 169.57 Mpa is within the allowable stress limit of 248.5 Mpa. Hence the linkspan is found to be structurally safe and adequate for 9 axial at a time condition.

Kindly also arrange to share the ballast sequence / loading conditions for the loadout operation to proceed with the intact stability checks.


Thanks and Best Regards,
From Aries Marine, UAE

Dear all 
Good day 

Kindly note that we had submitted our initial condition on even keel as per our present condition.

As per your request for ballast loading sequence, we must inform you that our ballast pump rate capacity is only 10tons per hour, so if you think that if we can maintain our even keel trim while loading, I believe it will take time to compensate the even keel while loading.

How ever the only thing we can provide is to prepare the initial loading condition draft required like what we did before from previous heavy lift and after the first loading of transformer then that the time we will do some ballast for second loading.

To make clearer from our side please advise us the required initial that's the only thing we can prepare for initial loading, ballast loading sequence to keep even keel, it will take time.

Dear Mr Haitham and team

Please note that we have reviewed the loading condition shared in the below email from LCT Bushra. Its noted that in the condition shared there is no trim for the vessel, however in the reference document for the previous loadout the aft trim was maintained for the vessel to adjust with the draft changes it the bow side when the load is happening. See snap below.

Please confirm if 0 trim will be maintained during the current loadout of 217T transformer. 

As per previous email from Mr @ minkyu.cha@samsung.com  "The BUSHRA-specific Method Statement v0.1 and the stepwise Loading Sequence will be re-issued immediately upon receipt from Mammoet" we await to get this document for our review and use.

• Cargo Weight: Corrected to 280.00 tons (TR Unit 217t + SPMT/Acc 63t).
• Ballast: Optimized to 200.00 tons (Reduced from initial estimate due to lighter cargo).
• Method: Shore Water Supply will be used to bypass onboard pump limits.
• Tank Verification: We will utilize Aft Tanks (FWB1/2). As per Tank Plan 757 TCP, these are confirmed at Frame 48–65 (Aft).

2. Stability Verification (Stage 6A - Critical)
• Trim: Perfect Even Keel (-0.10 m) at the moment of ramp entry.
• Fwd Draft: 2.77 m (Safe). This prevents deck submergence with ample freeboard (+0.88 m).
• Note: The high stern trim (+1.49m) during the preparation phase is an intentional counter-weight setup to prevent bow diving.

3. Operational Requirements
• Tugboat: Continuous pushing is required during Roll-on for station keeping.
• Depth Check: Please ensure >4.00 m depth clearance at the stern during the pre-ballasting phase.

Best regards,
```

Dear all 
Good evening 

Ref your below mail and notes,
• Tank Verification: We will utilize Aft Tanks (FWB1/2). As per Tank Plan 757 TCP, these are confirmed at Frame 48–65 (Aft).

Please clarify that your calculation based on (FWB 1,2 tank) is located on aft part of the vessel?
because mentioned tank is forward part of ship as per tank arrangement plan 757 TCP and as per 
Vessel frame sequence (48-65) that maximum forward of vessel.

Dear Captain and Yulia

Thank you for your message and for pointing this out.

To clarify, you are correct — the FWB1/2 tanks (Frame 48–65) are located in the forward section of the vessel as per the Tank Plan (757 TCP).

In my previous email, the wording "Aft Tanks (FWB1/2)" was inaccurate, and I appreciate your attention in highlighting this.

For avoidance of doubt:
• FWB1/2 = Forward/Bow ballast tanks (Fr.48–65)
• FW2 = Aft fresh water tanks (Fr.0–6)
• All calculations for ballast, trim, and stability are already based on this correct tank arrangement.

We have updated our documentation to reflect the correct terminology and RORO_Stage_Scenarios.

Thank you again for your clarification and continuous support.

Best regards,
```

Dear Mr. Cha and Mr. Kim, good morning!

Before sharing the necessary information, we'd like to clarify below remarks we had during checking the RoRo Visualization:

1. What's the total weight that was applied? 280t (including the SPMT) or 217t (TR's weight)?
2. Is the reaction of BOW correct when cargo with SPMT is on it? We see it goes up, though with DAS we experienced it went down, when we were passing by this area?

Once this is clarified, we will complete our RoRo Simulation drawings and calculations and will be able to share the necessary information with LCT Master and Aries Marine team.

Thank you!
Kind regards,
Yulia Frolova

Dear Yulia and team,

For clarification (refer to the attached Excel file shared in the previous email):

The transformer weight is 217 t, which is why the graph label shows "217 TON."
The simulation uses 271.20 t, consisting of 217 t (transformer) + ~54.20 t SPMT reaction load.

Both values are correct and intentionally used for different purposes (graph visualization vs. engineering stage calculations).

All Excel stages (271.20 → 310.20 → 581.40 t, etc.) remain fully consistent with this basis.

For the next step, all detailed RoRo stage-by-stage calculations (trim, draft, LCG/TCG/VCG, ballast sequence, and loading reactions) should be prepared and submitted by Aries, as required for their intact stability verification.

Best regards,
```

Adding OFCO & DSV Team to the loop, 

Dear Ouda, 
We will proceed with preparing the shipping plan for LCT Bushra with a target loading date of 6th January and will keep you duly updated on the progress.

Dear Yulia, 
The date you previously mentioned is now approached. 
We would appreciate it if you could kindly share the latest update of MSRA shortly. 
In addition, kindly check the mobilization status of the 12 m linkspan from Malaysia and advise the ETA at MZP.

The MRSA is required for Aries to complete the engineering calculations, and based on this, the vessel can be finalized. 
Subsequently, the MS can be issued followed by the PTW approval. 

We would appreciate your kind support in expediting this matter.

Dear Yulia

Two files are attached for your review.

File 1 – _LCT_BUSHRA_AGI_TR(20251217).xlsx
This file contains the baseline calculations.
It covers the full stage sequence, hydrostatic inputs, and trim/draft results for each RORO stage, including critical cases.

File 2 – _LCT_BUSHRA_AGI_TR_Ballast Plan(20251217).xlsx
This file presents the ballast operation plan derived from File 1.
It defines ballast transfer quantities and timing to keep the Forward Draft (Chart Datum) within the 2.70 m limit during critical RORO stages.

Both files should be reviewed together, as File 2 applies ballast measures based on the calculation results in File 1.

Dear Mr. Cha @minkyu.cha@samsung.com, good day!

Following our recent review of the ballast calculations submitted on 17 December, we would like to bring to your attention several critical observations that require further clarification.
Based on our assessment, all versions of the calculations provided to date contain discrepancies. For clarity, we will share a comparative table outlining the previous and updated values under separate cover:
 
In particular, the latest calculation raises the following concerns:
•	A minimum draft of 2.7 m, especially at the aft, must be maintained to ensure effective propeller operation in case of emergency.
•	The calculated LCT draft values exceed the allowable LCT depth, indicating that tide or seawater levels would encroach onto the LCT deck.
•	The tide level used in the calculation appears to be approximately twice the values indicated in official tide tables.

Dear Yulia, Captain Bushra Team, and All,

We have re-verified the full stage-by-stage outputs and issued an SSOT package with post-solve (solver) values injected into the consolidated Excel, including scope flags and transparency fields.

1. Gate Definitions (to remove ambiguity around "2.70m")
• Gate-A (Captain / Propulsion): AFT_MIN_2p70 → AFT draft ≥ 2.70 m
• Gate-B (Mammoet / Critical RoRo only): FWD_MAX_2p70_critical_only → FWD draft ≤ 2.70 m, applies only when Gate_B_Applies=1 (critical RoRo stages)

2. Full Stage-by-Stage SSOT (post-solve / solver)
ND Freeboard gate basis: Hmax=0.30 m, 4-corner monitoring → Req = 0.65 m.
Note: Gate-B is explicitly "N/A" for non-critical stages by definition (scope control to avoid false failures).

• Stage 6A is fully compliant for Gate-A/B/ND.
• Stage 5_PreBallast is short by 0.01 m on Gate-A only.

3. Closure action for Stage 5_PreBallast (AFT 2.69m, −0.01m)
To close this numerically (preferred for approval robustness), we will apply a micro-adjustment at Stage 5 only:
• Stage 5 only: increase FWB2 inventory by +1.65 t per side (example setpoint 21.45 t each side), then re-run and re-issue updated SSOT outputs.

Evidence will be shown in:
• pipeline_stage_QA.csv (Draft_Source=solver; Gate_AFT_MIN_2p70_PASS=1)
• solver_ballast_stage_plan.csv (DISCHARGE_ONLY proof: fill=0, discharge only)

4. Response to the three concerns raised 
A) AFT draft ≥ 2.70 m ("especially at the aft"):
• Confirmed as Gate-A (AFT_MIN_2p70). Stage 6A is PASS; Stage 5 will be closed by the micro-adjustment above.

B) Draft exceeding allowable LCT depth / deck encroachment:
• For the critical RoRo window (Stage 5/6A), drafts are controlled and ND freeboard gate is PASS.

Best regards,
```

Dear SCT Team, good afternoon,

Following today's call with MZP Authorities and their comment that the jetty area has a GBP limitation of 5 t/m², we would like to propose the following options for your consideration:

1. Maintain the current methodology with a GBP of 7.4 t/m² at jetty area, while OFCO seeks an "exceptional approval."
Please note that we have had similar experience at other Abu Dhabi Ports, where a higher GBP was permitted by the Harbor Master on an exceptional basis.

2. Install approximately six (6) units of 6 m × 2 m steel plates on the concrete section of the jetty (jetty ramp), which would allow us to comply with the permitted GBP.

Please note that the additional six (6) steel plates would be charged separately, based on the previously agreed Work Instruction for additional RoRo plates for DAS Island (WI attached), as detailed below:

• DAS: 2 pcs of 6 m × 2 m RoRo plates — lumpsum USD 3,000.00
• Proposed for Al Ghallan: additional 6 pcs of 6 m × 2 m steel plates — lumpsum USD 9,000.00 (including mob/demob)

Kindly let us know your thoughts on the above.

Kind regards,
